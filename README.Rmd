## rpart2tidy

This package converts the data for decision trees generated by the __raprt__ package into tibbles for use in ggplot. The __rpart__ and __partykit__ packages have many plotting options, but they are unique to those packages. By combining __rpart2tidy__ and __ggplot__ you can easily get consistent design across plots, using familiar arguments such as __geom_label__ and __geom_segment__.
