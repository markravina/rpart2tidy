rpart2tidy
----------

This package converts the data for decision trees generated by **rpart** into tibbles for use in ggplot. The **rpart** and **partykit** packages have many plotting options, but they are unique to those packages. By combining **rpart2tidy** and **ggplot** you can easily get consistent design across plots, using familiar arguments such as **geom\_label** and **geom\_segment**.
